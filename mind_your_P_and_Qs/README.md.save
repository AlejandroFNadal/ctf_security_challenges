Let's get the data:

wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/b9ddda080c56fb421bf30409bec3460d/values

First, lets see the file. It contains three lines, one for c, another for n, and another for e. This are elements of common descriptions of RSA. Also, the challenge and the file already mention RSA. 

RSA takes two prime numbers, multiplies them and produces n. We, of course, dont have these two values. If we translate directly n to a decimal value, we get 45959976767881369651642553602531796848068381789211007576197842634135566628967995489863096996296003

This number is not prime, which doesnt say much, but if it were prime it could not be n, as n is generated by the multiplication of two prime numbers in RSA.

Then, we have e, which should be coprime of n. e is 415031 in decimal. This page gives us the divisors of n. None of these include the divisors of 415031, so they are coprime. https://www.alpertron.com.ar/ECM.HTM .This is also a good sign.
